#Clayton's scripts

These are scripts that I have collected from the internet or put together myself.


##What do these files do
Most of these files are pretty self explanatory based off file name or the comments within the script. Most scripts will have header information giving credit/source of the file if not created by me.

_All files provided as is. You run it. You break it. You fix it. I hold no responsibility._
